# Sorting-Visualizer-V2
This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization, Helps to:understand the working of sorting algorithm, check total swaps required, check total comparisions, compare algorithms side by side, know the time taken (time is just an approximate unit for comparision)
Features:
*Sort any given array of 3 digits positive integers
*Alter the speed of execution
*Start, pause and reset the execution
*Generate random array of numbers of sorting
Technologies:
#React with hooks
#Styled components + React material (css and component libraries)
#Zustand (hooks based state management library)
#Vite (Bundler)
#Features built using
#Animations are done using pure CSS and uses FLIP principle
#Flex is used for array display and manipulation of positions (flex order property)
#JavaScript async generators are used heavily for the controlled execution of algorithms
